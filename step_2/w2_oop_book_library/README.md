#Book Library Project
- We will be creating a book library using the OOP principles of prototypes and prototypal inheritance.

##Steps:
1. Create a Book constructor that has all of the attributes of a book from the UI.
2. Create a constructor called SaveRender that will have two prototype functions - saveToLs and renderTemplate.
3. Create the basic logic for the above two functions without worrying about inheritance quite yet.
4. We will work together to create the inheritance structure for the functions.
